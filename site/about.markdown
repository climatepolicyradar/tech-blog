# Welcome to the Climate Policy Radar tech blog! 

This is where our teams think in the open: sharing our work, discoveries, challenges, and opportunities.

We believe in transparent, collaborative development. We talk about what we’re doing, what we’re excited about and what we’d love to hear other people’s thoughts on. 

Our content is technical in nature (which reflects our day-to-day work) but we strive to explain it as clearly as we can. 

We welcome questions, discussions, and requests for clarification. It’s also a place for us to celebrate our nerdiness and relish technical detail!
