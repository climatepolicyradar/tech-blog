# Welcome to the Climate Policy Radar tech blog! 

This is where our teams think in the open: sharing our work, discoveries, challenges, and opportunities.

We believe in transparent, collaborative development. We talk about what we’re doing, what we’re excited about and what we’d love to hear other people’s thoughts on. Our content is technical in nature (which reflects our day-to-day work) but we strive to explain it as clearly as we can. We welcome questions, discussions, and requests for clarification. It’s also a place for us to celebrate our nerdiness and relish technical detail!

# How to write for this blog

## Picking what to write about 

- Would someone doing my job find this interesting/useful?
- Will it help someone from making mistakes? 
- Is it something you’re working on, or about to work on? 
- Is it about challenges, solutions, and/or lessons learned? 

## How to write about it 

- Is it short and readable? (if not, make it into multiple partmore posts)
- Have you used subheadings to make it easier to read?
- Do your images have alt text? 
- Have you included practical examples where relevant? 
- Have you linked to related resources and references?

## Creating a kind blogging culture 

- If you worked with other people on this, are they recognised and acknowledged?
- Have you run it by Henry and Tam for a quick sense check? 
- Are you inviting comment and collaboration? 
- Is there a call to action?
